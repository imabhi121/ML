In this file I have added files related to the LinkedIn certification I did on Decision Tree. 

The main takeaway from this certification for me was that how decision tree works well with both classification and regression.
As well as the different measures it uses to do the recursive partitioning. 

I also gained understanding of pre-proning and post-proning to avoid over or under fitting of the data. 
Honestly, This certificatioin was very important for me in order to gain a foundational understanding of Decision Tree and how it works.

I'm Thankfull to LinkedIn Learning and the course instructor Frederick Nwanganga for making this course.

At last, I'm looking forward to apply this knowledge on real-world projects.
If you have any doubts or corrections for any files in this repo, then please do let me know.

Thank You.
